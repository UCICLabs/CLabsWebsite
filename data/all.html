                <p>This collaborative project, titled "Re-Crafting Mathematics Education: Designing
                    Tangible Manipulatives Rooted in Traditional Female Crafts," is based on our
                    prior work studying design, mathematics, and traditional female crafts,
                    particularly when integrated with electronics in what we call "e-textiles." As
                    part of this new project, we plan to extend this earlier work to better
                    understand how traditional female crafting practices can make far-reaching
                    improvements in a range of learning outcomes in science, technology,
                    engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. These types of investigations
                    will help reveal key issues underlying the underrepresentation of women and
                    girls in lifelong STEM learning.</p>
                <p>We are conducting a series of ethnographies of female crafting circles to better
                    theorize the connections particularly between mathematics and traditional
                    women’s crafts. In fact, we are coming to understand craft as a lived
                    mathematical practice -- that craft and mathematics are closely intertwined.
                    Following our initial ethnographic field work, we're planning to develop and
                    test a set of new hands-on classroom manipulatives for schools and after-school
                    programs (targeted at youth in grades 5-9).</p>

                <p>LRNG is a movement that closes the opportunity gap and transforms how young
                    people access and experience learning and the paths they can take to success.
                    Using technology to connect partnerships and learning opportunities both locally
                    and globally, LRNG holds the promise of delivering immediate, transformative
                    change to the millions of youth who are locked out of traditional paths to
                    success. LRNG will strategically scale up nationwide to close the nation’s
                    opportunity gap and ensure all young people can develop their full potential in
                    life and work.</p>
                <p>LRNG works with national and local content partners (like Fossil, Best Buy, Boys
                    and Girls Clubs) to create learning playlists that support high-demand academic
                    and workplace skills. Young people who complete a playlist earn digital badges
                    to document their learning and share with college boards and potential
                    employers.</p>

            <img src="img/projects/project_details_lrng_2.png" alt="" class="project-details-img-small">
            <p>This job readiness playlist — created in partnership with the nonprofit arm of GAP (Gap, Inc.) — is
                designed to help young people identify a career based on their interests, skills, and talents, and then
                prepare to succeed in that career. After inspiring youth by connecting them to a real-life success
                story, The Business introduces young people to life planning and reflection, soft skills for success,
                and the power of community volunteering. Through mood boards and organizational resources, the playlist
                helps youth realize that their personality has a direct relation to the types of jobs that are best for
                them.</p>
            <p>Upon completion of The Business, youth earn the Gap, Inc. Badge to document their learning. The digital
                badge can be added to their online portfolio, resume, and soon their LinkedIn profile. There are nine
                XPs in this playlist, designed to take about 12 hours to complete. Two of the XPs require learners to
                volunteer in the community and interview a local professional in their career choice, which adds to the
                time.The XPs work best in the sequence delivered in the playlist.</p>

            <p>This playlist, developed in partnership with the University of Chicago’s Center for Data Science and
                Public Policy, is designed to teach young people about civic participation and how digital technology
                offers them the opportunity to gather data on their cities and use that data to effect change. This
                playlist focuses on open data that are freely available for anyone to use, coupled with basic skills of
                data analysis.</p>

                <p>While new technologies have been largely absent in arts education curriculum,
                    they offer opportunities to address arts integration, equity, and the
                    technological prerequisites of an increasingly digital age.</p>
                <p>Peppler’s dissertation work draws upon the emerging professional field of “media
                    arts” and the ways that youth use Scratch and other new technologies for
                    communication as a way to design a 21st century K-12 arts education curriculum.
                    Building on sociocultural theories of constructionism as well as Dewey’s
                    theories of the arts and aesthetics as a democratic pedagogy, this work draws
                    upon over three years of extensive field study at a Computer Clubhouse in Los
                    Angeles where non-dominant youth accessed programming environments emphasizing
                    graphic, music and video.</p>
                <p>This study documents what youth learn through media art making in informal
                    settings, as well as the strengths and limitations of capitalizing on youth
                    culture in media art production and the distinct contributions that media arts
                    education can make to the classroom environment. Findings point to the ways in
                    which youth engage with technology that encourages active learning, and how new
                    types of software can be used to illustrate and encourage this process.</p>

            <p>Educators and researchers in the field of literacy are expanding on traditional notions of literacy to
                include decoding, evaluating, and producing electronic media. Yet many youth enrolled in special
                education courses are seen as lacking the skills and competencies for creative production in new media
                because they may not possess the ability to read and write in a traditional sense. However, prior
                research has revealed that such marginalized and preliterate youth are avid consumers and producers of
                media arts texts.</p>
            <p>This study examined this phenomenon to document, describe, and analyze the media arts practices of youth
                with disabilities within the context of schools participating in the one-to-one laptop initiative,
                contrasting their abilities with the common (mis)perceptions of these youth as being preliterate or even
                illiterate within today’s educational system. Aspects of new literacy studies, social theories of
                literacy, and constructionist learning guided the methodology and interpretation in this study. Media
                arts practices and the ways in which youth with disabilities make sense of new media are currently not
                well understood but have the potential to teach us about learning and literacy in the age of multimedia.

                <p>Complex systems are widespread and the conceptual ability to describe and examine
                    complex-systems-related concepts is generative, supporting youth in potentially

                <p>By conducting a series of systematic and crosscutting research investigations on new electronic tools and materials, such as toolkits for paper computing (i.e., paper, conductive paint, and electronics) and e-textiles, among others, which: (1) occur in the complexities of real-world settings such as schools and afterschool clubs; (2) include the development of a new set of assessments; (3) illuminate design principles for creating new tools and educational ecosystems to better support learning and equitable participation; as well as (4) the design of new toolkits and parts based on these emergent principles. </p>                                                                                                                 
                
                <p>The latest phase of this project focuses on robotics, integrating design, computing, arts, and computational thinking toward building kinetic sculptures. Designing and building kinetic sculptures using principles of art, block-based coding, inputs (sensors, buttons, switches), and outputs (servo motors, LEDs) furthers prior inquiry in gendered labor distribution and materials use, while expanding research on computational thinking through making, and designing new integrative learning experiences.</p>

                    This study, part of the broader Science Learning + (SL+) project Creativity and Equity in STEM Learning, asks the question: How does the materiality of tools and materials shape learning? Sub-questions include: How can robotics kits, integrating materials of arts and sciences, be assessed along dimensions that prove productive for deepening student engagement and creative production? Which of these kits best prepare students for future learning and why?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This study will select an initial set of toolkits that represent the full range of arts-and-sciences approaches targeted at teaching circuitry and robotics. The study will focus on how the materials shape youths’ understandings of key concepts as well as advance later learning. We are interested in how the materials shape the understanding of these constructs.

                    arts education and learning. This project involves a Research-Practice Partnership with Chicago Arts
                    Partnerships in Education (CAPE), a non-profit arts education organization that uniquely supports
                    long-term partnerships between professional teaching artists and public school teachers to create
                    arts integrated units bringing together arts disciplines such as visual arts, music, theater, and
                    dance with subjects like math, science, history, and language arts. CAPE identifies all teachers,

                    This project, Workforce Readiness for the Creative Economy of Southern California: Developing Pathways for Youth through Research-Practice Partnership, funded by UC-Irvine’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, builds on a long-standing partnership between Dr. Kylie Peppler and Los-Angeles based non-profit, Inner-City Arts. Inner-City Arts is a leading arts organization located in downtown Los Angeles that offers a variety of in-school, afterschool, weekend, and summer programming for middle and high school students through classes with professional teaching artists across a variety of visual, performing, and media arts disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project highlighted Inner-City Arts’ Work of Art programming to understand how the arts can support the development of learning pathways to effectively prepare the next generation of creative industry professionals. Broadly, this research is interested in understanding (1) how the arts can equip youth with foundational skills to enter and thrive in the creative economy of Southern California and (2) how personalized learning pathways create bridges between youth’s interests, skills, and authentic learning opportunities to build youth’s social networks and prepare them for the future of work. Through observations of Inner-City Arts’ programming and interviews with teaching artists and youth, we hope to show how the arts can support youth career development and connect youth to academic, civic, and economic opportunities.

                <p>We are researching how to encourage youth (ages 10 to 18) to creatively engage with e-textiles in
                    after-school and school settings. E-textiles integrate electronic circuits and computer technology
                    with cloth, allowing designers to embed fabric-based items such as clothing, puppets, bags with
                    electronics like LEDs, speakers, and wearable computers. Capitalizing on youths’ pre-existing
                    interests in new media, fashion, and design, while supporting learning and creativity in computer
                    science and engineering, this project encourages youth to contribute in meaningful ways to the
                    emergent field of computational textile design.</p>
                <p>Our lab is uncovering how e-textiles are potentially transformative both in terms of improving
                    learning outcomes as well as broadening participation in STEM fields today.</p>

            <p>The first of its kind, the 2013 Chicago Summer of Learning brought together organizations from around the
                country to provide Chicago youth with access to high-quality programs and exciting opportunities for
                hands-on learning during the summer. Using a badge system, youth selected activities that appealed to
                them and completed increasingly complex projects as they worked toward earning a City Badge at the end
                of the summer.</p>
            <p>The Creativity Labs @ Indiana University participating in this endeavor in collaboration with Digital
                Youth Network (DYN) and iRemix, offering badges in e-Fashion with soft circuits, Digital Storytelling
                with Scratch, Game Design with Gamestar Mechanic, as well as the exploration of circuits and speakers in
                pathways called DIY Sound Studio and Interactive Bookmaking.</p>

            <p>This project sought to explore environments like Quest Atlantis, Gamestar Mechanic, and Scratch to engage
                youth in narrative-based computer programming. Youth became the authors of their own transactive or
                interactive narratives, exploring the world and learning through play. Using a systems approach to
                creativity, Transactive Art encourages youth to become game designers, developing unique and original
                play spaces for their peers to enjoy. In the process, young designers learn fundamental computer science
                programming skills as they develop story algorithms to move their narrative games along.</p>
            <p>Representing a substantial contribution to computer science education as well as our understandings of
                social media and creativity, Transactive Art’s goal was to support students in structuring interactive
                narratives with innovative programming tools.</p>

                <p>The Learning and Achieving Through the Arts (LATA) program provides arts education to youth (grades K
                    through 6) who are facing barriers to succeed in school that stem from poverty, homelessness, and
                    limited English-language proficiency. LATA also offers professional development to participating
                    students' classroom teachers so they can support the integration of arts-based learning to improve
                    academic achievement in their schools. The Creativity Labs @ Indiana University is working to
                    enhance, document, and evaluate the model for this core arts integration, and to share it with other
                    school districts around the country. Anticipated outcomes include improved student performance in
                    English language arts, core art skills, and motivation to learn.</p>
                <p>LATA is a partnership between Los Angeles Unified School District, Inner-City Arts, The Creativity
                    Labs @ Indiana University, and the Centers for Research on Creativity (CRoC).</p>

            <img src="img/projects/project_details_lata_1.png" alt="" class="project-details-img-small">
            <p>Arts education has been swept up in two movements during the past decade: the increasing interest of
                cognitive researchers in the ways that learning in the arts may transfer to non‐arts learning and the
                advent of formal standards for learning in the arts disciplines. Research on transfer and assessment
                stands to benefit from high quality measurement of learning in the arts in order to gauge whether arts
                are the mechanism in transfer studies. Prior studies have focused on underlying theory of transfer,
                oversimplified models of transfer, and have used fMRI studies to suggest that there is a relationship
                between drama and language development.</p>
            <p>Building on these indicators of transfer in the arts, this project systematically investigated the
                mechanisms at work in the transfer of the arts to determine if we could identify what within the
                artistic practice acts as the mechanism of transfer. Building on our prior work measuring arts learning
                through observations we investigated an intensive 5‐week program targeting English Language Learners to
                determine if there are any measurable gains in (a) their English Language Development and/or (b)
                learning in Drama when compared to control group participants. Secondly, we sought to determine the
                relationship between Drama Learning and Academic English Language Development and identify key practices
                that are involved in the process of transfer between drama and the acquisition of new language skills.

            <p>This research study examined the effects of rich, sustained visual arts instruction on 103 inner city
                9-year-olds in two major US cities. We used the lenses of social learning theory, theories of motivation
                and self-efficacy, and recent research on artistic thinking to investigate the programs’ effects on
                children’s self-beliefs and creative thinking. The study enlisted a pre–post measure,
                treatment-comparison group design along with structured observations of participant and comparison group
                classrooms. The arts students made significant comparative gains on a self-efficacy scale and on an
                ‘originality’ subscale of a standard creativity test--effects attributed to children’s engagement in art
                and to the social organization of instruction including reinforcing peer and student–adult
                relationships. Relationships between self-efficacy beliefs and tendencies to think originally were also
                explored.</p>

                <p>Prior studies in music have attempted to address the failures of the music notational system to
                    reflect what is heard in the musical experience and to attract musicians trained to learn music “by
                    ear” (i.e., without learning to read or write music notation). Rhythmic action games, like the Rock
                    Band and Guitar Hero franchises, allow the player to fully immerse him or herself in the gaming
                    experience. As a result, players report following and reading ahead like a musician reading a
                    musical score as well as listening to music differently; they pick apart different things in the
                    song (i.e., bass, melody, rhythms, structure) and the gaming experience becomes a musical one.</p>
                <p>Our research into this phenomena—spanning youth, rock musicians, professional gamers with no musical
                    experience, music educators, and professional classical musicians—sought to understand more deeply
                    how rhythmic action games and the tools and representations of these types of games further mediate
                    preparation and participation in more formal music context. Our findings suggest that youth with
                    more experience in playing Rock Band do better in more formal music practices than those without it.

            <p>Creative Paths to Peace investigated how children develop musical and cross-cultural understanding while
                engaged in composing music and other arts-makerelated activities. Youth from the United States and
                Israel worked together to compose, construct, and remix their own tunes using Impromptu, a computer
                software interface that allows users to manipulate virtual blocks—tuneblocks—to create their own
                compositions. Early findings suggest that youth discussions about their shared music experiences changes
                the social, cultural, and historic context of what it means to compose music. Youth have been found to
                be developing and building their intuitive musical understanding as well as appreciate cultural

                    This project systematically investigated whether and how narrative elements of engineering design activities can influence engagement with those activities. The goal was to build evidence-based guidance for exhibit and program development and for facilitation of engineering design activities that can provide equitable, effective engineering design experiences for girls, who are often weakly engaged by challenge-based engineering design activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design-based research component of this project was conducted in the context of the development and testing of six new engineering design activities in NYSCI's Design Lab. The NYSCI development team created two parallel versions of each activity, one with narrative elements and one without. By testing each pair of activities, the research team from the Creativity Labs supported the refinement of understanding the kinds of narrative elements that most effectively invite girls into sustained engagement with the core engineering concepts and practices highlighted in each activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These activities, and emerging findings from the design-based research, were vetted and discussed with collaborators from two other science museums that also lead drop-in engineering design activities, including the Amazeum in Bentonville, AR and the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, CA.

                <p>Through a collaborative effort across a leading group of designers and educators from the Creativity
                    Labs @ Indiana University, Vanderbilt University, Institute of Play, the Digital Youth Network and
                    the National Writing Project, we’ve developed an innovative approach to supporting the development
                    of systems thinking in young people; one that allows them to explore a common set of ideas across a
                    diverse set of genres and technologies. The digital platforms featured in this project--digital
                    storytelling, e-fashion, e-puppetry, and game design--are each deeply rooted in youth culture but
                    wholly distinct, helping youth to recognize that systems are present everywhere in an increasingly
                    connected world.</p>
                <p>The resulting four-volume collection, Interconnections: Understanding Systems through Digital Designs
                    (available fall 2014 through MIT Press), is designed for school and non-school use and builds on the
                    existing work of educators, management theorists, designers, and learning scientists who are aiming
                    to promote systems thinking in young people. (See the list of volumes in this collection at the
                    bottom of this window.) The project uses a design-based approach to learning and offers up a toolkit
                    for supporting systems thinking in ways that are aligned to current Common Core State Standards and
                    relevant to youth (ages 8-18) interests in digital culture.</p>

            <p>Systems thinking is an important lens for all students to develop because if youth can learn to recognize
                systems principles, they can learn to not only appreciate the interrelated nature of disciplines but
                could transfer what they know to a broad number of domains—one of the greatest unsolved challenges for
                education.</p>
            <p>The Creativity Labs team is assisting the Bloomington Project School, through a grant from the Indiana
                Department of Education, in promoting students’ systems thinking skills and habits of mind, using

                <p>Make-to-Learn is an effort that leverages DIY culture, digital practices, and educational research to
                    advocate for placing making, creating, and designing at the core of educational practice.
                    Recognizing and articulating the powerful learning potential of making and DIY culture is critical
                    in broadening the reach of the Maker movement and in making programs centered on innovation,
                    creativity, and inquiry more accessible and appealing to educators and youth in under-resourced
                    settings. The broader vision of Make-to-Learn is an educational ecosystem that incorporates these
                    practices as a means to engage and inspire all young people towards lifelong collaborative learning,
                    experimentation, and invention. Our lab is uncovering how computational textiles are potentially
                    transformative both in terms of improving learning outcomes as well as broadening participation in
                    STEM fields today.</p>

            <p>MAKER Bridge was a series of webinars that brought together initiatives, experiences, academic
                understanding and practitioner expertise around the field of digital making. Drs. Julian Sefton-Green
                (UK) and Kylie Peppler (USA) hosted three online events during May and June 2013 to develop resources
                and conversations that are explicitly international and bring together expertise and experience from
                both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>The Series focused on three themes: Physical Computing and Making, Programming and Coding, and New Sites
                of Learning: Digital Makers In- and Out-of-School. The series speakers addressed the following
                questions: What is new about digital making now? Why is it important? How does digital making relate to
                other forms of creativity? How can we best organize digital making for children and young people? Is
                digital making difficult to teach? What is happening in digital maker communities and how can we link

                <p>It is known that the U.S. manufacturing industry has lost its global market share in past decades
                    while less developed countries have increased their manufacturing capabilities. Meanwhile, there has
                    been a simultaneous increase in the amount of research in computer vision using artificial
                    intelligence (AI) algorithms. A large number of small and medium industries have not been able to
                    understand, adopt, or adapt to new technologies because of risk in terms of time, effort,
                    infrastructure, and cost to apply robotics, IoT, or augmenting the human workers to compete in the
                    emerging future of factories.</p>
                <p>Our project takes a multidisciplinary approach to solving these challenges, addressing not only new
                    technologies for more effective collaboration between workers, robotics, IoT, and AI into the
                    product lifecycle, but also the ramifications that this shift has on education systems, and labor
                    economics.</p>
                <p>These activities, and emerging findings from the design-based research, will be vetted and discussed
                    with collaborators from two other science museums that also lead drop-in engineering design
                    activities.</p>
                <p>We plan to bring together expertise from The Creativyt Labs at UCI and Purdue University toward the
                    development of a physical-reality simulation platform (PRSP) for convergent technologies that will
                    focus on augmenting humans with robots and machines as a platform, and test this system.</p>
                <p>This platform supports the development of virtual factories in physical spaces, leveraging, and going
                    well beyond existing mixed reality (MR) and augmented reality (AR) (PTC is our partner and owns
                    Thingworx IoT platform and AR - Vuforia, see letter, GE Brilliant Factory letter). Such
                    physical-reality simulations will enable one to understand how to augment humans with changing
                    technologies, make key decisions before actual technologies are developed, iteratively test the
                    technologies closer to the real world, and as importantly, use it for future factory workers’
                    training and learning. We will complement this development with research on how to most effectively
                    pre-skill the future workforce on these technologies and requisite skill sets.</p>

                    to science and engineering and create technologies that can enhance the lives of American workers.”
                    Informatics Professor Kylie Peppler is part of a multi-organizational team, led by Professor Karthik
                    Ramani of Purdue University, that received a Convergence Accelerator award worth $1 million for its
                    project, “Skill-LeARn: Affordable and Accessible Augmented Reality Platform for Scaling Up
                    Manufacturing Workforce, Skilling, and Education.” </p>
                <p>The project comprises a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, mechanical and electrical
                    engineers, psychologists and education researchers. The goal is to tackle bottlenecks faced by small
                    and medium enterprises in terms of time and cost when addressing the need for larger-scale rapid
                    training. Through the lens of learning sciences, we aim to create and improve current approaches to
                    pre-skill a new generation of workers as well as refine our approach for industry re-skilling
                    efforts in our future work. For example, we are working to collaboratively develop and examine a
                    cloud-based educational network for cooperative AR that high schools and colleges can leverage to
                    help shape the future of the workforce.</p>

                <p>The goal of this research is to understand how to design online professional engineering courses to
                    be more efficient for learners and make inferences about what participants are actually learning.
                    This work will be used to inform how future courses are designed for Boeing employees.</p>
                <p>Researchers at Boeing and Indiana University desire to lay a foundation for the next generation of
                    online education for professional engineers through: 1) studying design principles for three large
                    online courses — Additive Manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing), Leadership for All, and the Boeing
                    AerosPACE capstone — that would increase the efficiency of time spent on learning; 2) developing
                    recommendations for the design principles of the Boeing AerosPACE capstone; 3) the development of
                    machine learning and visually techniques to find meaningful patterns in learner’s use of course
                    materials, including learner trajectory and learner proficiencies; 4) exploring what professional
                    engineers are learning through these education efforts that actually translate to on-the-job work
                    skills; 5) iteratively aligning course objectives to current research on the science of learning;
                    and 6) creating new peer assessment techniques and rubrics. There is a need to design courses in a
                    way that: inferences about learning can be made in a principled manner when machine learning/AI
                    techniques are applied, the data is organized so that queries about learners can be readily
                    obtained, and explorations on how professional education translate to on-the-job work for Boeing
                    engineers.</p>

                <p>This Innovations in Development AISL project is motivated by the insight that in the information age,
                    being able to “read and write” data visualizations is becoming as important as being able to read
                    and write text, and that in the digital information age, being able to create and interpret data
                    visualizations is an important literacy for the public. The research will seek to define, measure,
                    and advance data visualization literacy.</p>
                <p>The project will engage the public in using the xMacrocope at the science museum and research center
                    of the Science Museum of Minnesota and at the Center of Science and Industry (COSI) in Columbus,
                    Ohio. In both museum settings the public will interact with the Sportsology exhibit, where they
                    produce different datasets of their personal attributes and capabilitie. Using the xMacroscope
                    platform, they will then manipulate that data, creating diverse types of visualizations.</p>
                <p>A collaborative effort between partners of the School of Information and Statistics and the
                    Creativity Labs.</p>

                <p>Hive Research Lab is a research-practice partnership led by Indiana University and New York
                    University that studies and collaborates with the Mozilla Hive NYC Learning Network, a collective of
                    over 70 informal learning organizations in New York City focused on creating a city-wide ecosystem
                    of digital learning experiences. HRL was initiated in 2012 in response to interest from Hive
                    leadership at Mozilla and the Hive Digital Media and Learning Fund in understanding how research
                    might strengthen the network.</p>
                <p>The team engaged with the member community to develop a research roadmap rooted in member needs and
                    interests. From that three-month field scan emerged two key areas of work: understanding how to
                    support networked innovation (development of new initiatives, inter-organizational collaboration,
                    and cross-network knowledge sharing) and youth pathways (supporting long-term, cross-setting
                    interest-driven learning). HRL’s research and collaborations with Hive NYC members have produced
                    insights around participatory knowledge building methodologies, the affordances of “Working Open” in
                    a distributed network, and the importance of brokering learning opportunities as a way to support
                    youth pathways.</p>
                <p>The project is currently engaged in two projects with members of the network. In Building Youth
                    Pathways in Computer Science and Digital Making (CS-Paths), the team is collaborating with member
                    organizations Beam Center, Mouse, and SOW to develop brokering best practices that support the
                    learning and identity-building trajectories of teens across multiple experiences and settings.
                    Visions and Ideologies of Computer Science Education (CSed Visions) is a collaboration with Sara
                    Vogel at the CUNY Graduate Center that involves engaging with NYC-based CS educators and
                    organizations to give voice to the diversity of arguments for CS education.</p>
                <p>The project’s work is informed by literature in network and institutional theory, youth development,
                    learning sciences, design-based research and improvement sciences.</p>
